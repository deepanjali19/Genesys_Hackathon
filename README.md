# Genesys_Hackathon

This project was completed during the Genesys Hackathon that I participated in November 2017. It is a group project which I completed with Amrit Singh(User Experience Designer) and Pavan Kumar Kamra(Software Developer).

This project is about creating a cloud-based customer service for Best-Buy company using Genesys PureConnect platform. It makes it easier for the customer service representative to provide better information to the user. With the help of better UI, the Best Buy representative will be able to help the caller in less time.
